# Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) with Wav2Vec2 and QLoRA


## üìñ Project Overview  
This project develops a **Speech Emotion Recognition (SER)** system by fine-tuning large pre-trained speech models, primarily **Wav2Vec2** and **Whisper**, on benchmark emotional audio datasets. The system classifies emotions directly from raw `.wav` files, leveraging **parameter-efficient fine-tuning** techniques (LoRA / QLoRA) to balance performance with computational efficiency.  

The pipeline covers end-to-end SER: dataset preprocessing, feature extraction, model adaptation, training, and evaluation with industry-standard metrics.  


## ‚ú® Key Highlights  
- **10,000+ audio samples** across benchmark datasets: CREMA-D, RAVDESS, and TESS.  
- **Fine-tuned large speech models** (Wav2Vec2, Whisper) with a custom classification head.  
- Achieved **84% classification accuracy** across seven core emotion categories (disgust, happy, sad, fear, neutral, angry, surprised).  
- Applied **LoRA & QLoRA** for efficient fine-tuning:  
  - 4-bit quantization (NF4 format).  
  - Reduced training cost and memory footprint while sustaining model accuracy.  
- Comprehensive evaluation with **Accuracy, UAR (Unweighted Average Recall), F1-score, Cohen‚Äôs Kappa**, and confusion matrices.
